# Studio 1 ----

# 1. Be sure to read the instructions file: studio1-instructions.pdf

# 2. The instruction file gives instructions for testing your code. You can see the output of the tests in studio1-test-answers.html. You should use this to verify your code is giving correct output in the format asked for.

# 3. The handouts section (right side) of our MITx course page has a link for uploading you work.

# Problem 1: Tutorial ----
# See the problem 1 part of studio1-instructions.pdf

# Summary: Look at sections 1-5 of studio1-samplecode.r.
