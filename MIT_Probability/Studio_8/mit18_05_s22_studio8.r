# Studio 8  ----

# 1. Be sure to read the instructions file!

# 2. The test answers file gives sample output and the functions we ran to get it. You should use this to verify your code is giving correct output in the format asked for.

# 3. The handouts section (right side) of our MITx course page has a link for uploading you work.

# Summary of questions
# 1. Simulation of the f-statistic: draw histogram and graph
# 2. z-test. Code by hand a z-test
# 3. Chi-square test for independence
# 4. ANOVA. using aov()
